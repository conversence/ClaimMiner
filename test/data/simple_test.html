<h1>On mapping ideas</h1>
<p>Ideas are usually stated in natural language, and so are the links between those ideas. Though this is probably the easiest way to understand a small set ideas, it is easy to lose track of the links between many ideas presentend in this way.</p>
<p>Thus, it may be preferable to display the relations between individual ideas as a connected map of ideas. There are many ways to make such a map.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any statement of an idea is subject to multiple interpretations; comparisons also benefit from spatial organization.</p>
<p>Spatial organization has the benefit of leveraging spatial memory, provided the spatial arrangement is stable.</p>
