# On mapping ideas

Ideas are usually stated in natural language, and so are the links
between those ideas. Though this is probably the easiest way to
understand a small set ideas, it is easy to lose track of the links
between many ideas presentend in this way.

Thus, it may be preferable to display the relations between individual
ideas as a connected map of ideas. There are many ways to make such a
map.

Furthermore, any statement of an idea is subject to multiple
interpretations; comparisons also benefit from spatial organization.

Spatial organization has the benefit of leveraging spatial memory,
provided the spatial arrangement is stable.
